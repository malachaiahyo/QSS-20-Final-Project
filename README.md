# QSS-20-Final-Project

**Group members:** Justin Lee, Justin Pare, Malachai Ah Yo, Rohan Kommuri

## Description

Using the ICIJ Offshore Leaks dataset, we want to undestand how entity type (LLC, LTD, foundations, charities, etc.) varies across jurisdictions and regions, analyze the changes in popularity of specific jurisdictions over time and assess how these shifts may be influenced by laws and/or enforcement trends that happened around the same time as any shifts, and map regional concentrations of offshore leaks activity. We hope that this anlysis will help us to better understand how the movement of offshore wealth firms has changed over time and illuminate the impact of any legal, fiscal, and geographic forces which shape offshore wealth flows. 

Potential forms of analyis we hope to use on the data are listed below in **Potential Future Analyses and Visualizations**

## Data

For our analysis, we used the Raw Datasets from the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database which can be downloaded [here](https://offshoreleaks-data.icij.org/offshoreleaks/csv/full-oldb.LATEST.zip)

Our cleaned and merged dataset is stored in the cloud via google drive and can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z9M-1Y1Pn37JZcPvXb2bPylqt_4_Cf7u/view?usp=sharing)
