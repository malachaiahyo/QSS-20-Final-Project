## Description

Corporate tax avoidance through offshore structures and secrecy jurisdictions has become a defining issue in today’s economic and political landscape. Multinational corporations and high-net-worth individuals routinely establish shell companies, trusts, and complex ownership networks to shift profits, obscure beneficial ownership, and minimize tax liabilities. Although these arrangements often operate within the bounds of legality, they erode domestic tax bases, depress public revenues, and exacerbate global inequality. High-profile leaks, such as the Panama Papers and Pandora Papers, have laid bare the scale and sophistication of these offshore networks, galvanizing calls from policymakers, economists, and civil-society advocates for greater transparency, coordinated regulatory reforms, and stronger enforcement mechanisms.

In this project, we draw on the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ comprehensive Offshore Leaks dataset to explore the architecture and dynamics of offshore finance. By mapping connections between entities and their appointed officers, we examine which jurisdictions host the largest concentrations of shell companies and the legal or regulatory mechanisms, such as nominee-director requirements and citizenship-by-investment programs, that underpin these patterns. We further consider how offshore incorporation trends evolved around the OECD’s 2000 blacklist, comparing periods before and after its implementation to assess the effectiveness and unintended consequences of international sanctions. Through a blend of network analysis, temporal comparison, and concentration metrics, we hope to gain an understanding of how global oversight and local incentives interact to shape the ever-changing landscape of offshore finance.

## Data

We initially used the raw datasets from the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database which can be downloaded [here](https://offshoreleaks-data.icij.org/offshoreleaks/csv/full-oldb.LATEST.zip)

Our merged and cleaned version of these datasets is stored in the cloud via Google Drive and can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z9M-1Y1Pn37JZcPvXb2bPylqt_4_Cf7u/view?usp=sharing)
